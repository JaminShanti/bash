### Projects


Configuration Management
------------------------

Here is the basic annotated structure of this application:


Entended to provided global checking for environments where other configuration management tools are not yet deployed.

Assumption:  You need to already have your ssh keys deployed to all targeted servers.  
I recommend [ssh-copy-id] to accomplish this.
Usage:  
    - Populate set_env_serverlist.sh with the groups of servers you want to collect information.
    - Populate the Sample_Script.sh with a script you would like to run on each of these servers.
    - Sweep_servers.sh will run on each group.
    
```
Sample output:
